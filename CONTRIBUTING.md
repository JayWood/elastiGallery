# Pull Requests #
All pull requests should be made to the **development branch**, and use the lastest version of the development branch.
There are points in time in which the dev branch will be ahead of master, this is because the **master branch** is the
release branch.

To reiterate, you **should not** be developing on the master branch, pull requests to this branch will be ignored and closed.

# Issues #
* Be as clear and concise as possible
* Include a snippet of the shortcode that was used
* Include a list of your settings
* Screenshots HELP
