A plugin desgined to be a replacement for the default WordPress gallery in a responsive fashion.
This provides a slideshow for the `[gallery]` shortcode while keeping any other gallery you already
have working and intact.  

When creating a gallery, simply check the `Enable ElastiGallery` checkbox and that's it, you now have
a nifty gallery slide.

## Padding Posts ##
This gallery offers you the ability to add `posts` to the end of your gallery.  Increasing the amount of
traffic you get, and the clickthrough rate on your site.  Currently it only supports the default WordPress Posts
but I am looking into adding custom post type functionality as well at a later date.
